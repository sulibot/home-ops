# Cilium BGP Cluster Configuration
# This configures BGP peering with FRR container for LoadBalancer advertisement
#
# Architecture: RouterOS (65000) ← BGP → FRR (65101) ← BGP → Cilium (4200000101)
#
# AS Numbering Scheme:
#   AS 65000 - RouterOS (backbone router)
#   AS 65101 - FRR (BGP gateway on each node)
#   AS 4200000101 - Cilium BGP Control Plane (internal)
