# LoadBalancer IP Pool for cluster-101
# Dual-stack pool with both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs
# IPs from this pool will be assigned to LoadBalancer services
# and advertised via BGP to the upstream router
#
# IP Allocation Strategy for cluster-101:
#   Node subnet:     10.101.0.0/24   (fd00:101::/64)
#   Nodes:           10.101.0.1-63   (fd00:101::1-3f)
