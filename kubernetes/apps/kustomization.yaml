# NOTE: This file is NOT used by Flux directly.
# Flux reconciles kubernetes/clusters/cluster-101/apps/kustomization.yaml,
# which references the three tier ks.yaml files:
#   - kubernetes/apps/tier-0-foundation/ks.yaml
#   - kubernetes/apps/tier-1-infrastructure/ks.yaml
#   - kubernetes/apps/tier-2-applications/ks.yaml
#
# Each tier ks.yaml is a Flux Kustomization that points to its own directory,
# which has its own kustomization.yaml listing the individual app ks.yaml files.
#
# This file exists only for local tooling (e.g. 'kubectl kustomize' dry-runs).
resources:
  - ./tier-0-foundation
  - ./tier-1-infrastructure
  - ./tier-2-applications
